    <h1>Cognitive Biases. Learn. Practice. Recognise.</h1>


    <div class="intro">
        <p>Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from rationality in judgment and decision-making. They can significantly impact our thinking, leading to poor choices in personal and professional contexts. By recognizing and understanding these biases, we can improve critical thinking skills, make more objective decisions, and enhance problem-solving abilities.</p>
